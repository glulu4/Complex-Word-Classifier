# Complex-Word-Classifier
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifier. One file is missing, 'ngram_counts.txt', but it can be found here https://blog.research.google/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html.

To run, follow these steps: 
1) Start a python virtual environment 'python3 -m venv venv'
2) Activate the venv '. venv/bin/activate'
3) Execute 'pip install -r requirments.txt', which downloads all the requirments.
4) With (venv) in the front, you can run 'python3 classifier.py'. Just make sure you download ngram_counts.txt.
